## ABOUT THIS DEMO 
This is a web scraping demo with Playwright that demonstrates test automation.

By interacting with the website, code is generated to perform tests and verify that everything works correctly.

In this specific project, we perform a login with a specific username and password that need to be entered to reach a particular page. The test verifies that everything works correctly, ensuring that the data is entered properly and the specified page is reached.
